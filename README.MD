# CBake

* Definitions
    * Recipe - Needed dependency
    * recipe.json - Configuration file for a recipe
    * cookbook.json - Configuration file for project requiring recipes
* Purpose
    The purpose of CBake is similar to that of NPM: Provide easy C/C++
    dependency management and seamless transfer of machines and team 
    members. As far as I know, there is no good cross-platform C/C++
    library/dependency management tool, and I plan on changing that.
